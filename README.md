# E-Portfolio-Math-Programming

Here are some necessary infos to my E-Portfolio: Introduction into Mathematical Programming...


## Installation:

If you want to want to solve the example problem by yourself or together with me during Â´my presentation, here are the tools I use:

- Gurobi Optimization: the mathematic solver which does basicly all the work for you. you can get a free trial at <https://www.gurobi.com/> (you can get a free trial for upto a year if you are a student)

- Gurobi with Python (I used Anaconda, but everything should do as long as it is Python), how to get it can you find here: <https://www.gurobi.com/get-anaconda/> However you need the gurobipy package. This can be downloaded via the Anaconda packet manager or for example by using PIP.

- Any sort of editor that runs Python. I use Jupyter, which is pre installed with Anaconda, but something like Sublime or VS Code should work fine too. (with Jupyter however you can use the "Beispielaufgabe" notebook I uploaded.


Other than that, I should either mention the rest in my presentation or i will just add it here later on.

Have fun!
